# Neural Sequence-to-Vector Models

A collection of PyTorch implementations of neural sequence-to-vector models. The repo contains the following models:

- **InceptionTime**
  - Paper: Fawaz et al., "InceptionTime: Finding AlexNet for Time Series Classification" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04939)
  - Code adapted from https://github.com/hfawaz/InceptionTime

In addition, I implemented the following baseline models from Fawaz et al., "Deep learning for time series classification: a review" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04356)

- **Encoder**
- **Fully Convolutional Network**
- **Residual Network**
- **TimeLeNet**

## TODO

* Cleanup: Include `transformations` with repo; replace test code for grasping with frequency modulation
